        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Tubeify</strong> is a lightweight desktop application that allows users to effortlessly download <strong>YouTube videos</strong> as either <strong>MP3 (audio)</strong> or <strong>MP4 (video)</strong> files. 
            Built as a clean alternative to ad-filled online converters, Tubeify provides a smooth, one-click experience without requiring any technical knowledge.
            The goal was to create a secure, offline-capable tool that prioritizes <strong>speed</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>, and <strong>usability</strong> ‚Äî giving users full control over their downloads.

        <h2>How Tubeify Works</h2>
        <p>
          Tubeify leverages the powerful <strong>yt-dlp</strong> engine under the hood to extract and convert video or audio content directly from YouTube links. 
          Users simply paste a valid YouTube URL into the application and select their preferred format ‚Äî <strong>MP3</strong> or <strong>MP4</strong>. 
          With a single click, Tubeify processes the video, downloads the requested content, and stores it locally on the user's device. 
          No browser redirection, ads, or popups ‚Äî just pure, streamlined functionality.

        <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
        <p>
          Most free YouTube converters online are riddled with <strong>ads</strong>, <strong>tracking scripts</strong>, and often attempt to trick users into downloading unrelated software. 
          Tubeify was born out of frustration with this ‚Äî a need for a fast, clean, no-nonsense solution. 
          We wanted to create a tool that could be <strong>used offline</strong>, with zero bloat, and without putting users' privacy at risk. 
          By making it open-source and free to use, Tubeify puts <strong>download freedom</strong> back in the hands of users.

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
          Tubeify was built in <strong>Python</strong>, using <strong>customTkinter</strong> for the modern UI and <strong>yt-dlp</strong> as the core backend for handling media extraction. 
          The application was bundled into a standalone executable using <strong>PyInstaller</strong>, allowing it to run without any manual setup or dependencies. 
          Every button click, format toggle, and download action is handled through lightweight event-driven logic ‚Äî ensuring <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>simplicity</strong>.

        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
          The Tubeify UI was intentionally designed to be <strong>minimalistic</strong> yet <strong>modern</strong>. 
          Built with <strong>customTkinter</strong>, it features a sleek borderless window, custom icons, a live theme toggle, and clearly labeled format buttons. 
          Animations, color transitions, and visual feedback were added to make the interface feel responsive and intuitive. 
          Our goal was to make Tubeify feel like a native desktop app ‚Äî not a cluttered tool.

        <h2>Final Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          Tubeify achieved what it set out to do: deliver a fast, private, and user-friendly way to convert YouTube videos to MP3 or MP4 ‚Äî without ads, popups, or complications. 
          Its lightweight architecture and offline-first approach made it a practical tool that solves a real pain point for users.
          More than just a downloader, Tubeify represents a stance against bloated, ad-driven platforms. 
          This project was a valuable exercise in <strong>UI/UX design</strong>, <strong>Python packaging</strong>, and <strong>user-first software thinking</strong>.
