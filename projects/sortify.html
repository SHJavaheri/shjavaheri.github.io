        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Sortify</strong> is a lightweight desktop application that automatically organizes files in a directory by grouping them into categorized folders based on their file types. 
            Designed to reduce digital clutter, Sortify enables users to instantly clean up their messy downloads or desktop folders with a single click. 
            It‚Äôs ideal for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to keep their workspace neat without spending time manually moving files.

        <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone has experienced a chaotic Downloads folder filled with unsorted files. 
          We built Sortify to solve this universal problem in the simplest way possible: automate file sorting with no setup, no complexity, and no clutter. 
          Instead of manually organizing folders week after week, Sortify gives users an instant reset button ‚Äî helping them stay organized and productive.

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
          Sortify was built in <strong>Python</strong>, utilizing its powerful <strong>os</strong> and <strong>shutil</strong> modules for file detection and manipulation. 
          The application logic is straightforward, using conditionals and file extension dictionaries to map files to categories.
          To make the app distributable, we packaged it using <strong>PyInstaller</strong> so that it can run on any machine without needing Python pre-installed.

        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
          Sortify was originally built as a simple command-line tool, but later upgraded with a minimal graphical interface to improve usability.
          The final version uses a clean, single-window GUI where users can choose a folder and trigger the sort action instantly. 
          We kept the UI clean, functional, and beginner-friendly ‚Äî focusing on clarity and performance rather than unnecessary visual elements.

        <h2>Live Testing Results</h2>
        <p>
          We tested Sortify on real, messy folders containing over 200+ files in mixed formats.
          The application successfully categorized images, documents, archives, and source code files in under 3 seconds on average.
          It consistently created only the needed folders and avoided moving system files or hidden files. 
          No crashes, no conflicts ‚Äî Sortify worked immediately and saved hours of manual cleanup.

        <h2>Final Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          Sortify proves that even small tools can have a big impact. It turned the repetitive task of file sorting into a one-click operation ‚Äî 
          making it easier for users to stay organized and focused. 
          While the logic is simple, the benefits are real. 
          This project was a valuable exercise in <strong>automation thinking</strong>, <strong>Python scripting</strong>, and <strong>clean utility design</strong>.
          Sortify is a reminder that useful software doesn't have to be complex ‚Äî it just has to solve a real problem.
