        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Semestr</strong> is a fully integrated student dashboard app designed to centralize daily academic and lifestyle tools in one place. 
          It combines essential platforms like <strong>school portals</strong>, <strong>Google Calendar</strong>, <strong>Spotify</strong>, and <strong>to-do apps</strong> into a seamless experience.
          Built specifically for students, Semestr eliminates the need to constantly switch between tabs and log into multiple systems ‚Äî everything is accessible from one stylish interface.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Semestr uses secure OAuth integrations to connect user accounts across services like <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Spotify</strong>, and school-specific portals.
          Once logged in, each section is modular ‚Äî users can personalize their dashboard by dragging, rearranging, or hiding widgets.
          Real-time syncing ensures that calendar events, grades, assignments, and music playback are always up to date across platforms.

        <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
        <p>
          Students today juggle a growing number of apps and websites just to stay on top of their day ‚Äî school platforms, schedules, emails, music, notes, tasks.
          This app was born from that pain: constantly jumping between tabs, forgetting passwords, or missing due dates.
          <strong>Semestr</strong> brings it all together in one modern workspace that‚Äôs optimized for student mental load, convenience, and productivity.

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>
          Semestr is built using <strong>Tauri</strong> for ultra-light desktop deployment, with a frontend powered by <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
          It integrates <strong>OAuth APIs</strong> for secure authentication with Google, Microsoft, and Spotify, while also supporting local plugins and themes.
          The app is optimized to run natively on Windows/macOS and uses file-based caching to store preferences securely without any backend server.

        <h2>User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
          Semestr was designed to feel like a modern productivity dashboard ‚Äî with a <strong>glassmorphic UI</strong>, <strong>rounded modules</strong>, and a soft pastel color theme.
          The layout is modular: users can pin widgets like their music player, calendar, assignment tracker, or inbox wherever they want.
          Subtle hover effects, dark mode support, and iconography were added to give it a polished, responsive, and delightful feel on every device.

        <h2>Final Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          Semestr demonstrates how scattered student experiences can be unified under one elegant system.
          While still in development, it‚Äôs already a functional, smooth, and highly personalized dashboard that solves a real modern need.
          From OAuth flow to layout design, it was a rewarding challenge that strengthened our front-end, API integration, and desktop deployment skills.
          Semestr is more than just a student tool ‚Äî it's a productivity philosophy in app form.
