      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Secure ATM Banking System</strong> is a full-stack project designed to simulate real-world ATM banking operations with a focus on <strong>security</strong> and <strong>user experience</strong>.
        Built using <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>JavaFX</strong>, the system implements secure <strong>authentication protocols</strong>, <strong>encrypted transactions</strong>, and a clean <strong>graphical user interface</strong>.
        It supports <strong>account registration</strong>, <strong>login authentication</strong>, <strong>deposits</strong>, <strong>withdrawals</strong>, <strong>balance checks</strong>, and <strong>account deletion</strong>,
        ensuring that all operations are processed safely through <strong>server-client communication</strong>.
        This project highlights best practices in <strong>network security</strong>, <strong>data integrity</strong>, and <strong>responsive UI design</strong> for critical financial applications.

      <h2>Account Creation and Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        Users can securely <strong>register new accounts</strong> with a <strong>username</strong>, <strong>password</strong>, and optional <strong>initial deposit</strong>.
        Passwords must be confirmed through <strong>double-entry verification</strong> to prevent mistyped credentials.
        All authentication attempts are processed by the <strong>server</strong> using <strong>encrypted verification</strong> to ensure that login information is not exposed during transmission.
        Failed login attempts are properly handled, and successful logins transition users seamlessly to the banking dashboard.
        This approach mirrors real-world secure login systems and ensures <strong>credential safety</strong> throughout the process.

      <h2>Transaction Handling and Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        All <strong>deposits</strong>, <strong>withdrawals</strong>, and <strong>balance checks</strong> are transmitted securely between the <strong>client</strong> and <strong>server</strong>.
        Each transaction request is accompanied by a <strong>MAC (Message Authentication Code)</strong> generated from a session key to ensure <strong>data integrity</strong> and <strong>prevent tampering</strong>.
        Upon receiving a transaction, the server verifies the MAC before processing, ensuring that no unauthorized modifications occur.
        Sensitive logs such as transaction histories are <strong>AES-encrypted</strong> on the server side to protect records even if unauthorized access were attempted.
        This combination of <strong>integrity checks</strong> and <strong>encryption</strong> ensures end-to-end security of financial operations.

      <h2>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h2>
      <p>
        The user interface was built using <strong>JavaFX</strong> to create a clean, intuitive, and responsive experience.
        Users interact with the ATM system through distinct pages, including <strong>Login</strong>, <strong>Registration</strong>, <strong>Dashboard</strong>, and <strong>Transaction Management</strong> screens.
        UI elements were carefully styled for accessibility, featuring <strong>clear labeling</strong>, <strong>error prompts</strong>, and <strong>smooth navigation</strong> between operations.
        Custom styling ensures that even first-time users can easily understand how to create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw cash, and delete accounts securely.
        The front-end focus was to mimic a real ATM experience while providing an additional layer of usability.

      <h2>Server-Client Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Communication between the <strong>ATM Client</strong> and <strong>Bank Server</strong> follows a secure, session-based model.
        Upon login, a <strong>Master Session Key</strong> is securely exchanged using a <strong>Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication Protocol</strong>.
        This session key is then used to derive <strong>encryption keys</strong> and <strong>integrity keys</strong> for protecting all subsequent messages.
        Every action ‚Äî from balance checks to withdrawals ‚Äî is authenticated and verified, preventing replay attacks or unauthorized modifications.
        This architecture mirrors industry-standard secure communication protocols used in modern financial networks.

      <h2>Real-World Testing Results</h2>
      <p>
        The Secure ATM Banking System was tested extensively under simulated real-world conditions, including <strong>invalid login attempts</strong>, <strong>malicious packet modifications</strong>, and <strong>concurrent transactions</strong>.
        In all cases, the system successfully <strong>detected unauthorized actions</strong> and <strong>prevented data breaches</strong>.
        User authentication was fast and reliable, while transaction processing maintained low latency even under high request loads.
        Audit logs remained securely encrypted and were successfully decrypted for authorized review when needed.
        These results confirmed the system‚Äôs effectiveness in maintaining <strong>security</strong>, <strong>integrity</strong>, and <strong>performance</strong> in realistic operational environments.

      <h2>Final Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        The Secure ATM Banking System demonstrates how <strong>secure software engineering</strong> principles can be applied to simulate real-world banking operations.
        Through a combination of <strong>authentication protocols</strong>, <strong>encrypted communication</strong>, and <strong>user-focused interface design</strong>,
        the project delivered a fully functional banking environment resistant to common cyber threats.
        Key lessons included the importance of <strong>session key management</strong>, <strong>data integrity validation</strong>, and <strong>encryption best practices</strong>.
        This project serves as a strong example of combining <strong>backend security</strong> with <strong>frontend usability</strong> to build effective, real-world financial software systems.
