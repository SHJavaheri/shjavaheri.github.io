            <p id="aboutFirstParagraph">
                Hello, I'm <strong>Hamid Javaheri</strong>, a Computer Engineering graduate and passionate developer focused on creating reliable, efficient, and thoughtfully designed software solutions. I specialize in full-stack development and cloud technologies, with a strong interest in building products that are both technically sound and user-centric.
            </p>
        
            <div id="moreAboutMe" class="more-text">
                <p>
                    My academic foundation in <strong>Computer Engineering</strong>, combined with hands-on project experience, has shaped my ability to solve complex technical problems with a practical mindset. I believe that great software is built not just with code, but with a deep understanding of user needs, attention to detail, and a commitment to quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in <strong>front-end</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong> development, <strong>cloud</strong> deployment, system design, and project collaboration across diverse teams. My recent work includes full-stack web applications, cloud-based service platforms, and intelligent system integrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond formal projects, I have a strong interest in solving everyday challenges through innovation, whether that's developing custom hardware solutions or designing software tools tailored to real needs. These projects reflect my drive to create practical, user-focused solutions when existing ones fall short.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I aim to continue advancing my skills in cloud engineering, machine learning (AI), full-stack development, and system design, while exploring opportunities that allow me to build impactful, scalable technology. I’m committed to lifelong learning, meaningful innovation, and using technology as a tool to make everyday life better, both for users and for teams I collaborate with.
                </p>
